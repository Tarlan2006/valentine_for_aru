          <h2>Happy Hearts Day, my love!</h2>
          <p>Today we celebrate us, the love we share, and the beautiful connection that makes my heart feel at home. From the way your presence instantly comforts me to the love you give so effortlessly, you make every ordinary day feel special. Being with you fills my life with warmth, laughter, and a kind of happiness I never knew I needed. Every moment we share, big or small, is a reminder of how lucky I am to love and be loved by you. With you, even the simplest days feel extraordinary.</p>
          <p>On this day of love, I want you to know how deeply you mean to me. I promise to keep choosing you, loving you, and holding your hand through every season that comes our way. Thank you for being my heart’s favorite place, my constant, and my greatest gift. Here’s to our love today and to all the moments we will continue to create together. No matter where life takes us, my heart will always belong to you.</p>
          <p class="signature">Sincerely yours, <span>the love of your life</span> ♥</p>
