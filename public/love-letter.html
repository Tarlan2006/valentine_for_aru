          <h2>Dear my Arushka,</h2>
          <p>I want to congratulate you on such an important and magical day. On this special day for us, I want to open my heart and tell you once again how deeply I love you. It feels as if, day by day, my love for you grows stronger and stronger. I know we say these words to each other almost every day, but please never think they are just simple words - they are not simple for me at all. Every time I say them, they come from the deepest part of my heart.</p>
          <p>With you, I truly feel like I am at home. My soul feels calm and warm when I am with you, and that feeling is more precious to me than anything else in the world. I really want to walk the long, interesting, sometimes difficult road of life together with you, no matter what challenges may come our way. By the way, I am your biggest fan&lt;3, and every single day I wish you luck, happiness, and endless joy(always remember it!).</p>
          <p>And I know with all my heart that you will be an amazing doctor in the future - and that you will take care of me whenever I get sick. I truly hope that the most beautiful and intelligent doctor of all will be you.</p>
          <p class="signature">Sincerely yours, the love of your life ♥</p>
